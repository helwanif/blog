From one step to the other my confidence went down the gutter, after all these years and the different situations, tight schedules and crazy deliverables I was struggling to keep up. I had difficulties painting a picture I saw clearly in my head: the colors, the brushes, the canvas all looked and felt different... I knew what I wanted but what I considered a walk in the park became a night in hell. I ended up with a result that I felt ashamed to carry over along with my self-image.

Soon came the judgment day and the painting that I despised turned to be a piece of art. The daemons I once faced left deep exposed my true core. They proved that even it means loosing, I won't back off from a good fight, not easily at least.  To my surprise what I once considered a dead end turned to be the shield that spared me extra challenges. When I lost hope, the odds turned into my favor, the hope became a reality.

With that in mind I started answering the [questions that once haunted me](https://helwanif.github.io/blog/personal/2023/07/27/there-is-no-end.html): now is the time, now I want to jump because now I know exactly where and what I'll face next, and I'm up to the task ... Now I see the potential to push through new frontiers, a chance to entertain an addiction that I can't and won't satisfy.

On the downside, jumping mean wracking the boat. Jumping means putting others in danger after the distance we went through together. Such an idea pokes holes into my weaved dreams, pulling me down. "why are you doing this? How can we avoid it?". It breaks my heart, but I can't help it but to move forward.

The fire is relighted again, and I'm glad that there is enough substance to feed it, but I can't help it but to feel sorry for the causalities of such a feast. To all of you, although I am jumping to reach new depths, I am leaving part of me with you, because all that we went through together is something I will always carry, close to my heart.

It is again the time to explore new dimensions armed with undeteriorated focus and passion... There is more in there, because I believe so. Time to get to work.
