I can feel my heart pounding inside my head. I just finished the longest run I've ever done. Waves of pain and numbness are crashing through my legs, sending signals across my body that such an effort will have drastic consequences.

At the beginning, it was easy—nice pace, lots of motivated people around, enjoying the surroundings and staying in touch with everything running internally. I told myself if I kept doing this, it would be easy. A kilometer after another, time slowed down. I was alone, with no one I knew around. People were passing me by, and I started to feel pain crawling up my legs. At that moment, I wasn't questioning whether I'd finish or not; it was more a question of what condition I was going to finish in. The price I was going to pay was high, but I wanted to finish this. I would finish this, no matter what.

By crossing the finish line, everything calmed down. I’m not sure if it was the pain or the fact that I finished, but I felt a sense of accomplishment. I did it. Now it’s time to deal with the consequences—good or bad.

Days later, I’m still feeling the pain, but my sense of accomplishment is much greater. The question I get frequently—the one that justifies the pain—is: "Why are you doing this? Do you enjoy being in pain? Is it worth it?"

Reflecting on the experience, I can boldly say I did it to prove to myself and to everyone around me that I can go the distance. I can do whatever it takes to reach the finish line—and go beyond that. I wasn’t aiming to get a record time for the race. I wanted to finish it no matter what, and I did. I want to send a message: when I want to do something, I will go the distance, endure the pain, and keep pushing through—no matter what.

I want to send a message that even with long-lasting pain and suffering, my determination to reach my goal lasts far longer. I will reach the finish line even when I’m not prepared or trained. I want to say that, with technically no preparation, I still didn’t give up easily. It’s up to you to imagine what I can do when I am prepared.

"Why are you doing this?" I’m doing this because this is my statement: I will go the distance that none around me have gone, reaching goals no one around me has reached. If I survived this, then the next goal is even bigger. I ran alone and I reached where I wanted to go, and I have no problem doing it over and over. I reached the top of the mountain. Now it’s time to find a bigger mountain.
