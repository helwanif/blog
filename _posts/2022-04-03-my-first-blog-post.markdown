I've been thinking for some time about having a personal blog; somewhere where I do get the chance to write down my ideas, thoughts, maybe only to record some emotions towards a situation or even as simple as logging the feelings I experience during a moment in time. I think by you reading this I managed to realize that thought.

I want to be able to just dump things in writing and maybe -and I will explain the maybe part in few minutes- these will make a meaning to someone, be a reason to start some activity or at least acquire compassion and sympathy.

I say maybe because I can't tell since when I learnt not to share everything, hence comes the challenge of doing so through writing. There is a bit of uncertainty and a cracked confidence that such an idea -having a blog to write- is meaningful, helpful or appreciated. 

However by now I wanted to explore this frontier, to see where it will take me and for how long I can keep doing this, however I think at this stage what important is to start, and I'll get a chance to experience this first hand.
