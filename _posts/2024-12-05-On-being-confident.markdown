It has been an interesting journey so far, being engaged in a new workplace with a new team. Everything back then was new—everything from the simplest keyboard to career development dialogues. I’m certainly happy that the feeling of a “new start” is still there, even after a year.

On the other hand, a year is enough time to learn a thing or two, to demonstrate capacity, to show passion, and to sense the appreciation for the small contributions I’ve made here and there.

Looking back and trying to answer the question of what is needed to reach the next level, what gaps need to be filled to contribute even more, I realize that these were questions I struggled to grasp at the beginning. But after a year of experiencing the environment, I feel I’m in a position to answer them. In a few cases, I even feel humbled to have asked the questions in the first place.

That feeling of “humility,” or more precisely, that feeling of being shy—shy about answering a question or sharing a thought while standing next to someone more experienced, and shy about volunteering to take on more when I already have a full plate—is a complex one. It’s a bit like talking about being shy: a delicate origami structure that hides even more delicate thoughts within its folds.

Is that a justified reason not to give more? Is it a reason to hold back and not share the drive I have, or to refrain from using my skills to help finding answers even when I'm not asked to do so, when an answer is not expected from me?

Answering these questions may be difficult, as they are highly subjective. But one thing I know for sure is that none of these reasons is good enough to be seen as lacking confidence.

Being confident is not about knowing everything. It’s not about being the best in the room, the most experienced, or the most knowledgeable. Confidence is about being able to stand up and say, “I don’t know, but I can find out.” It’s about being able to say, “I can do this,” even when the task is hard. It’s about being able to say, “I can take this on,” even when my plate is nearly full. I have these qualities, and thinking about it, it feels wrong not to share them.
