A famous line from the Spider-Man movie is "with great power comes great responsibility", and to some extent I believe in that however with a twist: with great contribution comes some responsibility.

Another famous line is "the only constant in life is change" and change is most of the time disruptive: unless the status qou is now different, it is not an actual change. 

Combining these two, and I end up carrying lots of baggage along: my work is part of my life, my identity and my soul, pieces of me that I leave behind for someone to make use of building their next contribution. In worst case scenario leaving something to be remembered for, it can be a trigger of a painful memory, but I like to feel that I did my best "always" to leave on a good note.

To all of you gathering my soul's breadcrumb: please forgive my shortcomings and mistakes. Our engagement, our work together and the situation at the time are for sure positive memories on this side of the fence. Our roads crossed for some time and who knows, they may cross again once more. I am moving on, but I am taking pieces of you with me, holding my scars close to my heart, and remembering always the blood, sweat and tears along with the laughs we had together.

The march is started towards the new goal, this time with lots of medals hanging on my chest, reminding me of who I am and pushing me to new frontier.
