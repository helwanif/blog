For the last few months, I've been going through lots of changes on different fronts. It is no secret nor a surprise that change is the only constant in life and I believe that not only accepting change but also embracing it, utilizing it and driving value and benefit out of it is a key skill that is not easy to master.

Change is in most cases disruptive, and in most cases it means stepping outside the comfort zone and facing challenges and difficulties that are mostly not enjoyable. This is usually the case until the status que is reached, until a stable base is established which is by then represents the new comfort zone.

Since change was something I am used to, I have no problem facing new challenges. I went through this so often to an extent that sometimes I forced a change to experience such feelings. There is always good in any uncomfortable situation. Pushing the limits to explore new levels of "hardness" is the first and most basic benefit from such an experience, which is something I welcome at any time.

One of the challenges going through any change is facing the never answered question of "What if", or as derived from a value perspective: "is it worth it?". 

When I compare my productivity in the new environment against mine at my peak status of the previous environment I can't help it but to feel ashamed of myself, I know that it takes time to reach this peak status. I know that being extremely productive means mastering lots of knowledge. Acquiring knowledge takes time. Achieving mastery requires time. I keep telling myself I've done it before and I can do it again. I guess my struggle walking that road again is in downsizing my expectations of myself at the current moment to match the overall situation. I will excel of what I am doing, but in comparison to others or even to my previous self, whatever I am doing now is "basic" and "simple" in best case scenario.

To keep going, the answer to the question is yes: it is for sure worth it, even if this turns out to be something less than what I expect it to be. Going through the process molds a better person out of me. Someone who can -and will- do anything to achieve what he aims at. I am here and I will keep moving forward, no matter what.
