It has been an interesting year for sure, full of new experiences, challenging situations, and joyful engagements. It resembled everything I was looking for, and for that, I am truly grateful.

In the midst of all of this, I can't help but notice that fuzzy feeling that things are settling. It is becoming the norm to go through these experiences and achieve the next target on the same path, over and over. Yes, learning never stops, and there is always something new to pursue, but it is that smooth feeling creeping deep beneath, whispering: 'You are getting comfortable... and being comfortable is a good thing.'

But it is the same feeling that rings the alarm: once you get comfortable, you'll lose your edge; you'll stop growing. How do you find joy in doing something you're certain you can achieve? What fuels you to push harder, exploring things you've never experienced before, if you decide that this is good enough? This, among other reasons, is why I am not stopping here.

As part of the process of moving to the next step, self-reflection must result in an impact record: tasks, achievements, and goals that serve as bright stars, guiding you through the darkness, forming a beautiful painting of the personal and professional traits that helped you reach these targets.

However, I would like to label it differently: it is a record of the challenges I managed to conquer, the strengths I need to invest in even more, and the scars I hold close to my heart, believing that I managed to turn these incidents around. Such a record will be screaming: if these are what you managed to do, considering where you were a year ago, how will your record look a year from now? Will it be comparable to this one? Is that even good enough to be satisfied? Will you be content with the same degree of impact?

Some people are motivated by failure, but for me, success is an even stronger motivator. Succeeding in cracking a challenging task raises the question of ability: where and how do I find its limit? If I managed to tick all of these boxes, considering all the variables and uncertainties that came along with them, how about trying to tackle even bigger challenges, with much more challenging unknowns wrapping them?

Thinking about these questions comes with a tingling feeling that runs close to my skin. I don't know what an impact record is: my impact is clear to everyone around me. I know a motivational record that keeps me going, pushes me through my limitations, and always reminds me: there is still more in you than you think.
