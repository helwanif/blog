Working in software development, we have to work with existing code. This code can be an old functionality that was written long before we got involved and had to deal with, it can be a functionality that was developed by a different person or team or it can be our own code that we wrote at some point in history. Regardless of how this piece of code ended up on our screen, we have to deal with it.

Due to new requirement, I had to look at an old code. I found lots of duplicates, a method or two that can be generalized into more abstract implementation, few misleading comments that are not clear, and I had to jump between different lines and methods to understand how the several methods work together to achieve the desired outcome.

What made the overall experience a bit more interesting is that it was my own code: I implemented this alone couple years back. I find it interesting because I could generalize the takeaway into a more abstract idea which tells me a bit more about .... myself.

I believe that the activity of building software "software development, software engineering, or whatever term you, my dear reader, opt to use" is a mixture of art and science. There is the scientific side of it, where at each and every level or step, you find lots of concepts, standards or methodologies that govern to some extent what you are trying to do. On the art side of it, there are usually multiple ways of realizing what you are trying to do, there is no "one algorithm" to resolve a problem for example. There is always a space for the personal treats to come into play. It is the art side of it what makes the whole process a bit personal, never an objective activity or process.

When looking at code from that perspective, code, deliverables or artifacts become taste-rich elements. You can to some extent taste what you are dealing with, some code is spicy hot, some are cold and still. Some code is sweet to work with, some tastes bitter to handle and for sure some will give you stomach butterflies if you go through it.

Another perspective that I personally like is looking at code as poetry, of which it tells a story: a story of understanding, personal treats, systematic way of thinking and addressing problems, the compassion with others and the anticipation of future needs. Reading code is like following a breadcrumb of someone's ideas and state of mind. Reading someone's code is like getting into their brains and at the problem at hand through their eyeballs.Personal treats are reflected in code, you can tell if someone is assertive, conclusive, elaborative, even speed can be  captured at some point in certain forms.

all of this combined provides us with lots of feedback about ourselves. When I looked at my own code, it was interesting to see what I was thinking back then, how I addressed the problems at hand and in comparsion of what and how I would address these today, it tells a great story about my personal growth. Self reflection is a tool for growth, and being able to do it using physical means makes it more evident.
