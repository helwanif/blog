It has been a while since I had a chance to write something new. Although I had lots of things going on simultaneously that required lots of attention and efforts, I should keep my posts more frequent... and to my surprise I am not the only one who wants that. 

By reading the second book of David Goggins, I can't help it but to feel that I am still behind on couple frontiers. The man kept learning and pushing through to relatively an older age, and he managed to compete against others in different arenas, chasing the goal of being "uncommon among the uncommon".

I always believed that the mind is superior to the body, and I know for a fact that if the mind envisions something, the body has no other way but to achieve, however I always looked at ways to make the mind stronger by improving efficiency, trying smarter or more intelligent methodologies, tools or strategies to complete the task at hand, but the way that Goggins took to achieve lots of the great things he did was the complete opposite.

Doing something over and over until you master it requires no intelligence, in fact that is the most not-so-intelligent way of reaching a goal. The two books describe how putting things into place and focusing on one specific aspect until you master is regardless of how long it takes means that if I want to do something, I just have to repeat it over and over until I reach the goal I am aiming for. As Goggins keeps saying "the only way out of hell is through it", the only way to break through is to actually just break through. I know it sounds obvious but at the age of optimizations and shortcuts, it sounds a bit over simplified.

Today I tested that theory on a small scale, today I pushed through what I thought was my breaking point knowing that there is no other option, knowing that the only way out is the way through, and I made it through. That did bring lots of questions of what I was doing before! could it be really that simple: no fancy tricks, no complicated processes, just cast-iron focus and pure belief that we can go through the challenges we are facing? 

My little experiment today, although it was on very small scale, proved that I -too- still have lots of things that I can achieve, it is just a matter of belief and focus and going through the pain until it is not painful anymore. It is about knowing that the limit that I set for myself is something I can easily break through.
