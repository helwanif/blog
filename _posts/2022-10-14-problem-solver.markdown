There are lots that can be said under such a title, and over the years I came across lots of "problem solvers" who used the term to mark themselves as someone who can resolve issues whenever they happened. However, such a shallow definition is something I struggle with personally.

The reason for that is problem-solving is not only about applying solution B to problem A when it happens. I believe that problem-solving depends to a great extent on the mindset of the person, I am not talking about memorizing lots of solutions to different problems, I am talking about being thrown into problems and yet welcoming not knowing how to address them.

Both  people will be forced to deal with reality, but the first person will  only have to solve problems that actually occur while the second person  will often avoid taking action entirely because of the potential problems they have dreamt up before starting.

I believe that having the mindset the address whatever happens is the key differentiator here, because going through lots is something and surviving that is experience, but surviving lots does not mean that someone is a problem solver. It is easy to spot such a mindset when someone's first reactions to a situation is "due to this and that, I can't do so-and-so", and man how often I heard that.

I may not be a problem solver myself, but I will do whatever it takes to find a solution or come up with an answer. "Mr. Yes" is something that a colleague labeled me with, since I can not say no to any question or request that I get. Looking at the statement in isolation feels bit weird because in abstract it feels wrong, but I can't help it to positively respond to someone who is asking me to help.
