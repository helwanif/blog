Being someone who works in software development and in relation to which market I am currently working at, I get lots of questions if I am interested in new job position that is at a bigger, better or more interesting company. For some time I used to entertain whatever request I get since I was desperate to change, however since I ended up with my current employer I stopped doing that. I do enjoy what I am doing where I am doing it and there is no "strong" reason to change. Having said that, when something interesting comes my way I start thinking of the "better" things that I can earn at the new place, some of these could be new experience, better position, greater impact or simply put: more interaction with people.

By going through the hiring process I keep telling myself that I have nothing to loose but things to gain. worst case scenario will be that I get to assess my skills, my ability to sell them, and how I can maneuver tricky or problematic questions. By doing so I buffer myself for not being accepted, and I truly use such occasions to know where my weaknesses are and what I need to focus on for the next time.

However, rejection is not easy. Especially when things looked promising during the process itself. Even when I go through the process knowing the end, getting the response "thank you but no thank you" is hard. what makes it even harder is havin no clear feedback of what went wrong, did I miss a question or answered in a problematic way that triggered the reaction? what is my personal attributes or professional skills? wasn't I good enough? lots and lots of questions, and with such a storm, there is no clear path out.

I have no option but to move on, knowing that at some point I was examined but did not pass. There are lots of factors that can contribute to such outcome, what worries me are the ones that are within my control but I am not aware of, and that is the knowledge I want to gain from going through these interviews.

I think next time I will ask for feedback on the spot, stating that even if things go south, I want to know my weaknesses and what to work on next. till then, I've been through lots that I can use to overcome this rejection.
