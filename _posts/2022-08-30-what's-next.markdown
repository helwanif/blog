Since I finished my master and the workshop paper afterwards, the question keeps popping up over and over again: what's next?

I tried to look for an answer in several directions. Academically speaking, the next step is PhD, which I am not sure it will help me professionally except maybe applying for some universities for teaching positions. Professionally I think learning new tools or frameworks, looking into different fields other than backend system and infrastructure, or even volunteering to do some open source projects are all possible answers, however again I am not sure about the benefits of such decisions, and I am bit concerned about the commitment required to achieve something valuable at any of these. Sports wise things are not moving as I wish they do, however on that front I have to trust the process, as long as I am sure that every piece is in its right place. Personally some changes may happen and may not, either ways it will take some time to pose an impact on what I am considering to do - in case I decide on doing something -.

This weird feeling of not moving is itchy, something has to be done and I want to do it. However, there is still no clear answer.
