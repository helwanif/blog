I enjoy reading books that focus mainly on personal development or better understanding behaviour. I find it fascinating to explore the depths of the human spirit, the ability to better understand that unclear combination of physical and psychological factors that influence the interpretations and interactions between us as humans.

I am currently reading "You can't hurt me" by David Goggins and at first I thought it will be a story of someone who struggled to some extent, but going through the book I am surprised more and more taken away by the story.

The last chapter I read was "Taking Souls", and the concept behind is seems simple but takes lots to achieve for sure. The idea is to outperform the expectations at the lowest point of the performance curve. In a way to capture the respect "the soul" of the competitor when it is least expected, but only by doing what is expected but to do what is unexpected.

I will try that for sure, it will not be easy as it requires an extreme self control and an ability to push through the tipping point, but I want to try that on different aspects: professional and personal, at home, at work and in the gym.
