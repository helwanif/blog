Value is an important concept in our lives. We tend to assign a value to each and everything that we encounter. This spans from the basic things that we handle with the physical value like buying items using money, winning a prize or a trophy after a challenging activity or acquiring good grades or results after extensive investment in time and effort.

But looking a bit deeper into the concept of value, we use this concept to reflect on self value, that is how we see ourselves in relation to what we should get from others as a reward of our value. If one of us is interacting with a much younger person, or someone of a less social or professional tier, we tend to expect a certain level of appreciation and interaction due to our "self value".I assume, at least, that is the case in some of the environments and societies I experienced.

How do we define our self value? what are the factors and the reasons that justify a certain level of self value? how can we define the process of "self evaluation" to be as objective and neutral as possible?

I came across these questions since the such definition establishes how someone sees him or herself and therefore governs how that person deals with others.

In my pursuit to answer the questions, I noticed that there are lots of possibilities that people use as a basis for self evaluation. The age, the social situation or title, the financial situation or the academic title, even the religious beliefs make good ground for reasoning to lots of people.

I think out of all the possibilities I came across, the one that I personally disagree with the most is the one that says "I am valuable because I am of who I am, I do not have be, do, belong or change anything. I am worthy because I am who I am as I am currently". To be honest, I disguise such mentality to an extent that I can't bear being with someone of such mentality at the same space. This also spans to reasons that outside's someone's control nor effort, but yet used as reason to feel self worthy "I am valuable because I have blue eyes, or blonde hair. I'm proud of being tall".

How on earth do you value yourself based on something that you have which has nothing to do with you? no one controls how he or she looks, and the "just being" part is even crazier. What you got could be handed over to someone else, which should bring its value to zero to you.

One of the reasons that makes sense to use a ground for self evaluation is the benefit to others. I like to measure my self worthiness based on the value that I provide to others. This spans to all the interactions that I do on different levels. Self worthiness is in this context how helpful we are to someone else: resolving a problem, helping with a task, even sharing the pain or at least in worst case scenario preventing harmful activities or negative impact on others. The more I do this the more I like to think that my value has increased.

When we start looking at ourselves through the lens of our impact on others, we change from self centric maniacs to unselfish activists. This doesn't mean that we cancel ourselves, but it is to value who we are in light of what we do to others. By doing so, our ceiling of expectations is controlled by our contributions and efforts towards others.

I hope that one day, such an idea, such a mentality and such a concept is what is known about me when I'm gone. This is the legacy that I want to leave behind and if this is how I want to see myself, this is how I want people to see me too. This is the legacy I want to leave behind for my kids to follow through.
