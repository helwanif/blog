For some time now I feel settled and I enjoy being in my comfort zone. Most of my days look very structured and the same patterns repeat over and over. Recently couple incidents happened left me haunted by few questions. Questions that I can't get out of my head.

From one perspective, my daily routines and patterns are history, every day there is a new plan that requires adjustments. I have no problem with keeping up, my problem in such situations is the price I have to pay to be able to keep up with all these variables. 

At some point I started to collapse, it felt like I can't keep up with what's going on around me, I can't be keep up anymore, I can't give more or remain clam. To the rescue I recalled some of the stories and wisdom I came across recently, and that did help for sure. Not to forget that at such times, it is the support of our beloved ones that forms the basis of our raise and come back. For that I am always grateful.

On the other perspective, it is my daily routines and patterns that haunt me, pressing a question against my forehead: is it going to stay like this? isn't there anything better to try, experience, learn and use to grow even more. Unfortunately on this frontier, the question is still floating unanswered.

I am not sure if I should again reflect on the wisdom that says: forget about the goal and focus on the process, because in such context the goal is the process itself. The process of experiencing different environment, being challenged to the bone, stepping out of comfort zone and last but not least be more affective leaving bigger and more obvious mark. In such a context, it is hard to decide what to do next because any decision will trigger losses, pain and suffering for some. 

This inner drive, the endless hunger to have more and grow more, does it justify wracking the boat when there is no other way but to jump out of it? when jumping will leave everyone on board less protected.

Taking a step away from all of this and looking how I am missing my routines on one aspect but also suffering due to sticking to routines on another aspect, I find it fascinating to crave some habits while complaining about others. Humans are creatures of habits, and our habits is what dictate how we interact with our environment. I think it is our habits that defines us, but also it is our habits that limit us. The missing piece in such a puzzle is how to decide promptly when to break a habit to form a new one. The only question that remains unanswered is: when to take that leap of faith and jump into the unknown.
