During a recent work interaction, I was asked about the choice I made to do what I've done. The question wasn't about why I picked a specific task; it was more about why I continued working on the task despite knowing and later discovering its complexity and the effort required to understand what was needed and to come up with a solution.

On a professional front, we face different difficulties. This is to be expected regardless of the work, position, seniority, experience, or task we discuss. Challenges are inevitable; they are to be expected in any position that requires a certain level of skills, capabilities, and flexibility to address the unknown.

There is always some fear when facing the unknown, with questions like "Where do I start?" or "Is this good enough?" to the extreme of "Whoever looked into this before me is surely better and more knowledgeable. Do you expect yourself to find a solution when they couldn't?"

I appreciate being in an environment where mistakes are considered part of growth, where learning by doing is highly encouraged, and where people are there to support each other. At first, I was a bit shy to step forward and do things that were considered "too early," "too complex," or even "too many at the same time" for someone of a similar calibre. But whenever I remember the people around me, when I remember the support they offered and continue to offer, I can't sit back without trying to raise my chin to reach the bar. I can't help but step forward and wave my hand, shouting, "Me, me, I am in... I can take a look... I want to do that."

Having a supportive environment is a blessing for sure, but that doesn't take away the burning sensation of tackling a complex problem, especially when labeled "complex." There is pain in banging one's head against a wall trying to figure out a solution. It is, to some extent, embarrassing to take weeks to address an issue that is time-boxed to a day. But putting all that aside and answering the question at the beginning of this post: There is no sense of accomplishment in doing something easy, no growth in doing something known, and no fun in doing something not challenging. Hard is relative to knowledge, experience, and the appetite to tackle it, and there will always be something hard for someone. But I can't back off from going through hard just because it is hard, knowing that once I'm through it, my skills, knowledge, and experience will become greater. For such a reward, I'm willing to pay the painful price any time.
