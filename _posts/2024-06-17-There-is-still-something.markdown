It has been a few months since I started a new engagement, and during these months there have been a few other changes that caused a lot of instability. So far, I am not complaining.

Among all that's happening currently, is it too much to want to give even more? Isn't it enough to maintain the pace and just push through? Can it be that there is still energy left somewhere to spend on more engagements? For a normal person, these are legitimate questions to ask, especially when the current bar is already set high enough for most people. This is, for sure, a lot to do, but it is not enough.

What keeps boiling down under all the activities and in between times of different experiences is the urge to give even more, as if there is something still hanging that is struggling to come out. It is coal glowing under loads of ashes; at some point, all it takes is a strong wind to blow away that thick blanket, fiercening the fire once again.

It is about [taking souls](https://helwanif.github.io/blog/personal/2022/05/09/taking-souls.html), and I will keep pushing even further as long as I'm able to do so. The rest I'm seeking is in knowing that I did not waste the time and energy I have, not leaving any stone unturned, and not missing the chance to try or experience something new. It is not being satisfied with what I've done and am still doing so far, not because it is not good, but because there is still capacity to give even more.

There is still something to give; it is just a matter of time before I find it. Hey you, mountain, I'm coming for you.
