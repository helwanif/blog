Within the last few years I flew to different countries for different reasons, and since I consider myself somehow a frequent traveller flying mostly on the same airline, I got a chance  to memorize all the safely instructions that are played in few languages. I never paid attention to these especially that understanding the different languages makes the repetitive instructions extremely boring.

Few days ago and while reading a book out of my usual comfort zone, I came across a reference to one of the instructions that I heard every time I boarded a plane. This comes at the end of the lengthy set of related instructions of what to do when the oxygen masks are dropped in case of an emergency. After lots of details, you'll hear "Put your own oxygen mask first before helping others".

If taken within its context, there isn't really anything special about that... it makes sense to be honest. However in the context of the book I am reading it was brought up as an indicator that before helping others, you need to secure yourself, otherwise your ability to help will last as long as you do, and in case you let yourself exposed or without being secured, that duration won't be long. Again this makes perfect sense and again there is nothing special about it.

The idea that popped into my head was: does it make sense to generalize this statement even further? for example, does "Respect yourself before respecting others" make sense? if we take this a bit further and flip in backward it becomes even more interesting. When you help others putting their masks on, it is assumed that yours is already on, or at least that you managed to secure yourself before helping others. Now the fun begins.

If we generalize this idea and apply it to different concepts and merits of ourselves, it becomes fascinating. "Respect yourself before respecting others" becomes "If you show respect to others, it is an indicator that you have a high level of self respect", if we apply this on trust: Trusting others means that you trust yourself - trusting the way you are treating people -, if your forgive others, it means you accept and handle your own flaws and mistakes in mature way.

I am not sure if I am taking this too far, however I feel that our way of treating others is a strong indicator about our internal dialog and how we see ourselves. There is a saying of "the one who does not have something can not give it to others" and if I witness the giving part I can assume that the giver is content with what he is passing on. Knowing people's internal by looking at their external interactions with others becomes really easy, simple but scary to some extent.
