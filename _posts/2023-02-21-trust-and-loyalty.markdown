How can we define trust and loyalty in the professional context? a question that crossed my mind listening to a justification of why employees keep leaving an organization.

In a relation between an employer and an employee, there are lots of variables that impact how a company treats the employee and how in return the employee treats the company. I think this can be simplified to a relationship between the employee and the manager, and in such a relationship lots of factors play major role in the actions and reactions between the two.

If such a relation is based on what each party offers to the other, what does it say about the personalities of the two? and by scaling this out to a more abstract level: when an employer-employee relationship is shaped based on what each party gets out of the other verses what is offered, is it exaggerating to say such a relationship will collapse over time, since it is founded on shaky ground.

I believe that the way a person behaves and treat others tells a lot about the personal perception and self awareness that the person has. When you find yourself shying away of doing something just because "I can not fit into such a behaviour.... I do not see myself doing that.... it feels wrong!", then it does not matter what you get from the other side of the relationship, personal or professional. In such context, the evaluation criteria is of a different level, and such a criteria, although it goes unnoticed, speaks a lot of its owner.
